### Objectives and Procedures

* Use network analysis and topic modeling to examine the content around the #StopTheSteal hashtag shortly before and after the storming of the U.S. Capitol. The purpose was to see what topics and people were associated in the minds of those tweeting #StopTheSteal at this time.

* I scraped all tweets containing #StopTheSteal from Jan. 5 until Jan. 7. That was about 16,000 tweets from about 7,000 acccounts. The data did not include follower lists, which are more difficult and far more time consuming to scrape. 

* Note: Twitter permanently suspended more than 70,000 accounts that were "primarily dedicated to sharing QAnon content" in the days after Jan. 6. This naturally affected the results, but I thought it was worth examining the content generated by people not primarily concerned with spreading QAnon content.

* I conducted network analysis on co-occurrences of hashtags and mentions, as well as topic modeling on the text using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. I chose only the most frequently occurring hashtags and mentions to build the network graphs.

#### Getting even more selective offers a clearer view of some of the connections among hashtags. The thicker the lines, the stronger the connection.

#### Zooming in on sub-graphs in the main graph offers a more granular view. #MAGA was the hashtag most strongly linked to #StopTheSteal.

#### Naturally, the name Trump was also closely linked to #StopTheSteal.

#### This Japanese phrase translates roughly as "turn it over," with revolutionary connotations. QAnon has a significant following in Japan.

### Conclusions

* Network analysis requires a great deal of context and interpretation. It is clear that despite the removal of tens of thousands of QAnon-driven accounts, the content surrounding #StopTheSteal remained highly conspiratorial and angry. 

* Many of the most prominent QAnon slogans remained at the center of the conversation, as did many of the people most associated with QAnon and conspiracy theories regarding the election. These included Ezra Cohen, Brandon Straka, Sydney Powell and Lin Wood. Far right news organizations Newsmax, One America News and Breitbart News also remained at the center of the conversation. Senator Josh Hawley, the subject of much derision in the mainstream media, did not receive much attention in tweets with #StopTheSteal. 

### Further Consideration

* Given more time, I would like to scrape and examine the user-follower networks. I would also like to use clustering and word embedding to get a clearer look at the segmentation of communities and conversations. 

* I also plan to automate this entire process, to enable quick and reproducible examinations of Twitter conversations.
