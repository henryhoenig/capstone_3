# Examining Twitter content around #StopTheSteal

&nbsp;


* I scraped all tweets containing #StopTheSteal from Jan. 5 until Jan. 7, shortly before and after the storming of the U.S. Capitol. That was about 16,000 tweets from about 7,000 acccounts. (Note: Many accounts were permanently suspended by Twitter in the days and weeks after Jan. 6.)

* Then I conducted network analysis on co-occurrences of hashtags and mentions, as well as topic modeling on the text using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. 

* The purpose was to see what topics and people were associated in the minds of those tweeting #StopTheSteal at this time.
